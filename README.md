# Issue tracker for Codewars content

This repository is used to track issues related to Codewars content:
kata, translations, solutions and kumite.

It can be used to report and track following types of issues:
- Issues which can be addressed only by admins. However, since
administrators are often busy with maintenance of the platform, these
are expected to be processed slowly and probably wait until appropriate
tools will be provided to moderators. 
  - Putting a kata back to beta
  - Retiring an approved kata
  - Deleting an approved translation
  - ... 
- Issues which can be handled by moderators. Currently, moderators have
limited capabilities of fixing kata, but have large set of functions
 available for handling submitted solutions. Moderators can:
  - Move a *beta* kata to draft, 
  - Flag solutions as cheats, 
  - Revalidate solutions which do not pass tests anymore but did not get
invalidated automatically, 
  - Hide solutions which are valid, but should not be visible for some
 reason, for example solutions of a 7 kyu kata which are spoilers and can
be used to solve a challenge version kata of the same problem. 
- Issues which can be handled by other users. Such issues can usually be reported
with an appropriately labeled post in kata discussion, but they are difficult
to track and search for, so after the issue gets reported there, it can be
also duplicated here on this board. Good candidates for such issue are:
  - Kata with locked tests which can be fixed only by power users, 
  - Kata which stopped working after the update of code runner
(equivalent of "List of kata to update" from current wiki), 
  - Translations in not widely known languages, which require attention of users
with specific skills, 
  - Kata which need to be fixed by entering the kata editor, but reporter does not
have sufficient privileges or does not want to forfeit,
  - Bad descriptions: fix markdown, or review of grammar and wording by users with
sufficient language skills, 
  - ...  
Users who enjoy maintenance activities and willing to improve quality of kata
are encouraged to view issues on this board and pick them for processing one by one. 


## Issues board

TBD: describe labels and templates after they get set up

## Discussions

Github discussions can be used when users want to discuss some issue
and are not sure which way of fixing it would be the best. For example,
discussions can be used to discuss ranking of a kata to be approved 
when votes are not conclusive, determine whether kata are duplicate and
preferred way of de-duplicating them, or agree on preferred way of fixing
some kata. 

## Projects

Project board can be used to track progress of particular issues.
